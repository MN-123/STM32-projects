# STM32-projects
This repository houses all of the STM32 projecs I want to share with the world.

Most projects' structure follows that of GNU ARM eclipse, althogh not all of them are developed using it.

This results in the following folder structure:
- Debug: holds the makefiles, objects, etc when building for debug
- Release: same as debug, but used when buildig for release
- include: project header files
- src: project source files
- system: library files
- ldscripts: linker scrips used
